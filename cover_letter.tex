Advocating for Free Software, as in Freedom, is one of the main objectives of my professional and activist life.
That was the main reason that led me to found a Free Software Group on the University. I have been using, producing and contributing to Free Software since 2007 and it was always prerequisite on my jobs and personal projects, and everything I have recently produced is on my recent jobs are on my github account.}

I have started my Web Developer career in 2002, while in school, learning mostly on web forums. My engineering course prepared me to the challenges of technological career, in which there is a constant need for learning new technologies, and it also thought me the relevance of multidisciplinary knowledges working together.

My main experience is on the web field. I have been using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Drupal, Wordpress, Django and Mediwiki, MySQL and PostgreSQL but I have also some experience as SysAdmin, both as professional and activist.
Among my activities on the University Free Software Group (\href{http://polignu.org}{PoliGNU} - \url{http://polignu.org}), I taught Gimp, Inkscape and LaTeX, organized Install Fests and promoted workshops about Free Software philosophy to the community.

Besides my strong independent profile, I enjoy and do well working within a team or a community. I feel glad to contribute on management and strategic decisions when required. I am able to take on the responsibility of this position immediately, and have the enthusiasm and determination to ensure that I make a success of it. Work at FSF would be a life objective achievement.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

\hfill Yours sincerely,

\hfill \textbf{Diego Rabatone Oliveira}
