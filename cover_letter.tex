\textbf{To: Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry}\\
\textbf{About:} Community Development Lead position\\

\vfill

\langif{br}{Caro(a)}{Dear Sir or Madam},

\vfill

my name is Diego Rabatone Oliveira and I am a passionate free software and open
knowledge advocate. I was recommended by Raniere Silva (The University of
Manchester) to apply for this opportunity.

\vfill

I first met Raniere in 2015, when I participated on a Software Carpentry (SC)
workshop that he organized at UNICAMP (Campinas, Brazil). Since then I
collaborated, as instructor, in two SC workshops that he organized in São
Paulo.

\vfill

My goal to participate on that first SC Workshop was to better know its
structure, by reason of being involved with courses and workshops organization
forasmuch as 2007. These workshops were the genesis of PoliGNU, a free software
studies group which I co-founded in 2009 while on the University \- and still a
member of, but now remotely contributing with with web contents, social media
and some punctual activities, like the Open Data Day that happened on March
04th, 2017.

\vfill

During that period I have taught free technologies such as GIMP, Python, among
others, and I have also supported about 10 editions of a LaTeX course that we
developed, summing up more than 500 students from 2009 to 2013.

\vfill

Likewise I participated on a project called ``Cadernoteca'', a wiki site where
the students from the university could, collaboratively, write their classes
notes. Later this lead me to get involved with Wikipedia and help them doing
some introductory workshops.

\vfill

For the last few years I have been working mainly as a developer, always using
free technologies and publishing my work under free licenses (see my GitHub for
more information). That was the case while I was working at the Brazilian
newspaper O Estado De São Paulo with data driven journalism, or when I
consulted for Open Knowledge Foundation. The same applies for my work as UNDP
consultant for the Brazilian Justice Ministry.

\vfill

All in all, I think I can contribute with both Software and Data Carpentry
organizations towards its missions and that opportunity eagers me to face the
challenge build a Brazilian community around Data Skills and Open Knowledge.

\vfill

Thank you for taking the time to consider my resume.

\vfill

\hfill Yours sincerely,

\hfill \textbf{Diego Rabatone Oliveira}
